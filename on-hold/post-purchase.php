		<blockquote>"Rejoiner’s abandoned cart retargeting platform was a critical part of our email strategy during the holiday season. Implementation was fast and we started seeing results immediately. Even better, the ROI was clear and  tangible. Rejoiner’s platform was easy to work with and flexible enough to meet our unique retargeting requirements"</blockquote>
